  abstract = {Background: Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers used to treat postoperative urinary retention (POUR) may also have a preventative role. Here we assess the evidence behind their prophylactic use on POUR prevention. Study design: PRISMA guidelines were followed. All studies reviewed for eligibility, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Pooled risk ratios with 95\% confidence intervals calculated using a random effects model. Heterogeneity assessed using Forest plots, I2 statistic and Chi-squared Cochran's Q-statistic.
Results: Fifteen RCTs (1732 patients) included. Prophylactic alpha-1 adrenergic blockers significantly reduced risk of POUR, 13.16\% vs 30.24\%, RR \textonequarter{} 0.48 (95\%CI: 0.33; 0.70, p-value \textonequarter{} .001), without a statistically significant increase in adverse events. Substantial heterogeneity found between included studies (I2 \textonequarter{} 65.49\% [95\%CI:48.49; 95.01] \& Q-statistic 43.46 (p-value{$<$}.001)). Subgroup analysis revealed strong risk reduction and little heterogeneity in males (RR:0.33, 95\%CI:0.23; 0.47, p-value{$<$}.001, I2:10.58) and patients receiving spinal anesthesia (RR:0.26, 95\%CI:0.14; 0.46, p-value{$<$}.0001, I2 \textonequarter{} 0\%).
Conclusion: Prophylactic alpha-1 adrenergic blockers reduce risk of POUR in males and after spinal anesthesia.},

  abstract = {The ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) gene is on the X chromosome and its product catalyzes the formation of citrulline from ornithine and carbamylphosphate in the urea cycle. About 10-15\% of patients, clinically diagnosed with OTC deficiency (OTCD), lack identifiable mutations in the coding region or splice junctions of the OTC gene on routine molecular testing. We collected DNA from such patients via retrospective review and by prospective enrollment. In nine of 38 subjects (24\%), we identified a sequence variant in the OTC regulatory regions. Eight subjects had unique sequence variants in the OTC promoter and one subject had a novel sequence variant in the OTC enhancer. All sequence variants affect positions that are highly conserved in mammalian OTC genes. Functional studies revealed reduced reporter gene expression with all sequence variants. Two sequence variants caused decreased binding of the HNF4 transcription factor to its mutated binding site. Bioinformatic analyses combined with functional assays can be used to identify and authenticate pathogenic sequence variants in regulatory regions of the OTC gene, in other urea cycle disorders or other inborn errors of metabolism.},

  abstract = {Conversion of nitrogenous waste to urea via the urea cycle is regulated by factors that respond to nitrogen load to prevent toxic ammonia buildup. Six enzymes, N-acetylglutamate synthase, carbamylphosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthase, argininosuccinate lyase and arginase 1 (ARG1) are essential for ureagenesis. Most urea cycle disorders result from mutations in coding regions or splice sites, but regulatory region changes may also contribute. To analyze urea cycle transcriptional regulation we used Cis-Element Over Representation (CLOVER) software to find transcription factor binding motifs in conserved regions. Candidate binding sites for Estrogen Receptor and BRCA1 were found in the ARG1 promoter. Binding will be verified using an avidin-agarose pull down assay and western blotting. We also screened patients with OTC deficiency that lack typical mutations, for changes in OTC regulatory regions. We identified three single nucleotide substitutions as disease-causing candidates in the OTC promoter; two in a known HNF-4 binding site and one in a conserved region of unknown function. These changes were absent in 800 alleles from persons of Caucasian, Hispanic and African decent. Bioinformatic detection and molecular verification of regulatory factors is critical to understanding the urea cycle and for better diagnosis of disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The short-term natural history of blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) has been previously described in the literature, but the purpose of this study was to analyze long-term serial follow-up and lesion progression of BCVI.
METHODS: This is a single institution's retrospective review of a prospectively collected database over four years (2009\textendash{}2013). All patients with a diagnosis of BCVI by computed tomographic (CT) scan were identified, and injuries were graded based on modified Denver scale. Management followed institutional algorithm: initial whole-body contrast-enhanced CT scan, followed by CT angiography at 24 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 4 to 6 weeks, and 3 months after injury. All follow-up imaging, medication management, and clinical outcomes through 6 months following injury were recorded.
RESULTS: There were 379 patients with 509 injuries identified. Three hundred eighty-one injuries were diagnosed as BCVI on first CT (Grade 1 injuries, 126; Grade 2 injuries, 116; Grade 3 injuries, 69; and Grade 4 injuries, 70); 100 ``indeterminate'' on whole-body CT; 28 injuries were found in patients reimaged only for lesions detected in other vessels. Sixty percent were male, mean (SD) age was 46.5 (19.9)years, 65\% were white, and 62\% were victims of a motor vehicle crash. Most frequently, Grade 1 injuries were resolved at all subsequent time points. Up to 30\% of Grade 2 injuries worsened, but nearly 50\% improved or resolved. Fortysix percent of injuries originally not detected were subsequently diagnosed as Grade 3 injuries. Greater than 70\% of all imaged Grade 3 and Grade 4 injuries remained unchanged at all subsequent time points.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Grade 4 blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI4) has a known, significant rate of stroke. However, little is known about the natural history of BCVI4 and the pathophysiology of subsequent stroke formation.
METHODS: A 4-year review of patients with BCVI4 at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center was performed. Rates of BCVI4-related stroke, stroke-related mortality, and overall mortality were calculated. The relationship of change in vessel characteristics and BCVI4-related stroke was examined, as was the mechanism of stroke formation.
RESULTS: There were 82 BCVI4s identified, with 13 carotid artery (ICA) and 69 vertebral artery BCVI4s. BCVI4-related stroke rate was 2.9\% in vertebral artery BCVI4 and 70\% in ICA BCVI4 patients surviving to reimaging. Stroke mechanisms included embolic strokes, thrombotic strokes, and combined embolic and thrombotic strokes. Peristroke vessel recanalization and an embolic stroke mechanism were seen in 100\% of ICA BCVI4-related strokes developing after admission. BCVI4-related stroke occurred within 10 hours of hospital admission in 67\% of the patients with strokes. Contraindications to anticoagulation were present in most patients with BCVI4-related stroke developing after admission.

  abstract = {There is a paucity of data regarding the utilization of palliative care consultation (PCC) in surgical specialties. We conducted a retrospective review of 2321 adult patients (age {$\geq$}18) who died within 6 months of admission to Boston Medical Center from 2012 to 2017. Patients were included for analysis if their length of stay was more than 48 hours and if, based on their diagnoses as determined by literature review and expert consensus, they would have benefited from PCC. Bayesian regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 99\% credible intervals (CrI) of receiving PCC adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance status, median income, and comorbidity status. Among the 739 patients who fit the inclusion criteria, only 30\% (n = 222) received PCC even though 664 (90\%) and 75 (10\%) of these patients were identified as warranting PCC on medical and surgical services, respectively. Of the 222 patients who received PCC, 214 (96\%) were cared for by medical services and 8 (4\%) were cared for by surgical services. Patients cared for primarily by surgical were significantly less likely to receive PCC than primary patients of medical service providers (OR, 0.19, 99\% CrI, 0.056-0.48). At our institution, many surgical patients appropriate for PCC are unable to benefit from this service due to low consultation numbers. Further investigation is warranted to examine if this phenomenon is observed at other institutions, elucidate the reasons for this disparity, and develop interventions to increase the appropriate use of PCC throughout all medical specialties.},

The Science DMZ model is an established solution to help maximize the throughput from any given network infrastructure between sites but there still exists room for exploration and improvement, including the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). We aim to explore how the use of SDN-enabled flows in a Science DMZ may impact its main trait: performance. In this paper we have successfully demonstrated improvements in data transfer between certain sites and under certain conditions. Though we have also seen sites where there is no difference or even a performance penalty, all the results are consistent and reproducible over hundreds of test transfers suggesting there are unique properties of each site configuration leading to real and sustained performance increases to a Science DMZ.},
