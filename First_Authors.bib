  abstract = {Background: Emergency general surgery (EGS) represents a diverse set of operations performed on acutely ill patients. Those undergoing EGS are at higher likelihood of complications, readmission, and death, but the effect of primary language on EGS outcomes has not been evaluated. We aimed to evaluate the association of non-English primary language on outcomes after EGS operations. Methods: The New Jersey Statewide Inpatient Database from 2009 to 2014 was used to evaluate cases representing 80\% of the national burden of EGS. Cases were restricted to ages  18 y, emergency department admissions, noted to be emergent or urgent, and performed between 0 and 2 d after admission. We evaluated Spanish speakers and non- English, non-Spanish (NENS) speakers compared with English. Outcomes included inhospital mortality, 7-d readmission, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Logistic and negative binomial regression was used, and generalized linear mixed models were used to account for hierarchy in the data. Results: There were 105,171 patients included. English speakers were majority white and with private insurance; Spanish speakers were younger and with fewer comorbidities. Where differences between Spanish and NENS speakers existed, NENS were more like the English-speaking group. Adjusted results indicate that Spanish speakers had reduced LOS after appendectomy (IRR: 0.92 [0.89-0.95]) and lysis of adhesion [0.93 (0.88-0.97)]. Spanish speakers had an increased LOS after higher risk operations (IRR: 1.14 [1.10-1.20]). NENS speakers had a reduced LOS after adhesiolysis (IRR: 0.94 [0.89-0.99]). There was no difference in mortality or short-term readmission},

  abstract = {Background. Few studies have evaluated the effect of primary language on surgical outcomes, and no studies have addressed operations typically performed for cancer diagnoses. This study aimed to determine the effect of primary languages other than English on outcomes after surgical oncology operations. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed adults undergoing operations typically performed to treat cancer using the NJ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database during the interval of 2009\textendash 2014. Language was grouped according to English-, Spanish-, and non-English/non- Spanish (NENS)-speaking groups. The study evaluated inhospital mortality, 7-day readmission, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Logistic and negative binomial regression methods were applied, and generalized linear mixed models were used to account for nesting within a hospital. Results. This study analyzed 37,531 cases. Non-English speakers were of lower economic status, more likely to be admitted on the weekend, and more likely to undergo higher-risk operations. The likelihood of death in the riskadjusted multi-level models did not differ between Spanish speakers (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.41\textendash 1.10) and NENS speakers (OR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 0.77\textendash 1.75). Readmission rates exhibited high inter-hospital variability (intra-class correlation, 53\%). The odds of readmission among Spanish speakers in the non-hierarchical model was increased (OR, 1.50; 95\% CI, 1.11\textendash 2.02), but this was ameliorated in the multilevel modeling that accounted for variability between hospitals (OR, 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.93\textendash 1.80). No changes in LOS were observed. Conclusions. No independent association was observed between primary language and outcomes after operations typically performed to treat cancer in the study population. The higher proportion of weekend admissions may suggest more acute or advanced presentations for non-English speakers. Long-term outcomes may be necessary to discern an impact.},

  abstract = {Background: Incidental adrenal masses are those that are found on imaging performed for any nonadrenal evaluation. Published guidelines define accepted follow-up criteria for incidental adrenal masses; however, adherence to these guidelines and barriers to appropriate follow-up are not well understood. We aimed to describe practice patterns for the discovery, evaluation, and follow-up of incidental adrenal masses. Methods: Medical records of patients with an incidental adrenal mass underwent retrospective review at a tertiary referral and level-1 trauma center, as well as regional ambulatory care locations. Individuals  18 years of age with an incidental adrenal mass identified during 2016 were included. Patterns of evaluation, follow-up, and associated adrenal diagnoses were determined. Results: From a total of 19,171 cross-sectional imaging procedures (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), 244 patients with new incidental adrenal masses were identified. A majority (52\%) were discovered as part of an evaluation in the emergency department. Of 153 patients with an identifiable primary care provider, approximately 75\% had an in-network primary care provider, and 12 (7.8\%) had both follow-up imaging and biochemical evaluation. Twenty-three percent of patients with an innetwork primary care provider underwent an appropriate cross-sectional imaging procedure in follow-up compared to 29\% for a non-network primary care provider (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .54). Patients with a mass described with benign terminology were less likely to undergo follow-up imaging compared to those with indeterminate terminology (5\% vs 37\%, P {$<$} .001). Patients with imaging ordered as an outpatient were more likely to receive follow-up with imaging (22.8\% outpatient vs 11.5\% inpatient, P {$\frac{1}{4}$}.042). There was no difference between any groups regarding biochemical evaluation, which inappropriately was performed in only 15\% of patients with an incidental adrenal mass. Conclusion: To optimize follow-up of incidental adrenal masses, efforts should be made to assure and prioritize inpatient/emergency department incidental findings and to communicate to the appropriate primary care provider the necessary next steps for evaluation. Further, efforts to increase biochemical testing should be pursued.},

  abstract = {Background: Emergency general surgery (EGS) is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and seven procedures account for 80\% of the National burden of operative EGS. We aimed to characterize the excess morbidity and mortality attributable to these procedures based on the level of procedural risk. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. (2005e2014). Seven EGS procedures were stratified as high risk and low risk. Primary outcomes were overall mortality, overall morbidity, major morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression was performed. Results: There were 619,174 patients identified. Comparing EGS to non-EGS in high-risk cases the OR for overall mortality was 1.39(1.33,1.45), overall morbidity 1.07 (0.98, 1.16), and major morbidity 1.15(1.03,1,27). In low-risk cases the OR for overall mortality was 1.03 (0.89, 1.19) overall morbidity 1.35 (1.23, 1.48), and major morbidity 2.18(1.90, 2.50). Conclusions: Using a Nationally representative clinical database we identified significant heterogeneity in the outcomes of EGS depending on procedural risk. Risk stratification and benchmarking strategies need to account for the inherent heterogeneity of EGS.},

  abstract = {Background: The effect of decreased overall hours of training in surgical specialties is still being examined. Of particular interest is the safety of patients undergoing surgeries with trainee surgeons. The aim of this study was to identify if there were significant differences in outcomes of patients undergoing commonly performed thyroid and parathyroid surgeries when trainees were involved. Materials and methods: Postoperative complication rates, length of stay (LOS), and total operation time (OT) data were gathered from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database. The cases were identified by CPT code and were divided based on the training level of the participating resident surgeon: Junior (postgraduate year [PGY] 1-2), senior (PGY 3-5), fellow (PGY {$>$}5), as well as an attending-only group where no resident was present. We compared the clinical outcomes, LOS, and OT in each trainee group to the attending-only group as the reference. Results: A total of 84,711 cases were identified of which 45.33\% involved trainee participation. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence interval for overall, neurologic, and bleeding complications were calculated. No difference in the odds of overall patient complications or neurologic complications was observed. A decrease in the odds of bleedings complications when a junior or senior trainee was present was observed. Overall complications in operations including a junior trainee (PGY 1-2) had an OR of 1.04 (0.85, 1.29), a senior trainee (PGY 3-5) had an OR of 1.00 (0.89, 1.13), and a fellow had an OR of 0.98 (0.74, 1.31). Mean OT was found to be significantly different between attending only and junior and senior trainees. There was no significant difference in OT between fellows and attending only. LOS did not meaningfully differ across groups. Conclusions: In three commonly performed thyroid and parathyroid operations, there is not an increased overall or neurologic complication odds when a surgical trainee is involved; there are decreased odds of a bleeding complication.},
