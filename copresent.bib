  abstract = {Introduction: There have been many changes to surgical education over the last few decades. With increased attention to patient safety, there is a push to better prepare our medical students prior to starting a surgical residency. We present our results from a pilot study of creating a senior medical student surgical boot camp including analysis of the learner's perspectives of boot camps.  Methods: Graduating senior medical students entering a surgical residency underwent a voluntary three-day surgical boot camp. Pre-and post-surveys were used to evaluate confidence levels of common patient management issues as well as technical skills. Qualitative analysis of a focus group using a general inductive approach was used to develop themes surrounding students' perceptions of boot camps.      Results: Ten medical students completed the boot camp. We found that most students were somewhat confident (3 on a 5-point Likert scale) in their abilities to manage common intern problems with increased variation among students for technical skills prior to the boot camp. Students all had improvements in confidence scores post boot camp for all measured tasks. From our qualitative analysis we found that students prefer a voluntary, surgery specific boot camp at the end of medical school as oppose to the start of their residency. Being given the choice to partake in the intervention provided the participating students with more motivation during the boot camp, supporting adult learning theory. Some of the students' major concerns include being the first point of contact for patient issues as well as being the first responder to patient emergencies. Students worry about their ability to multi-task and manage a large amount of information which differed from their experience as a medical student. In addition, students are realistic about their expectations from a preparatory boot camp and value it as an experience to help ``jump start'' their transition to residency.    Conclusion: Our pilot study suggests that surgical boot camps may successfully improve students' confidence in patient management and technical skills prior to the start of their intern year. In addition, we found major themes surrounding students' perceptions of boot camp which may assist with future development of these programs. Students prefer a voluntary boot camp and value the experience at a medical school level. In addition, they are realistic in that a preparatory course will not teach them all they need to know prior to residency but more as a tool to help their transition.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine whether a difference in outcomes exists for non-English-speaking patients compared to English-speaking patients after operations commonly performed to treat cancer. We hypothesized that language discordance between providers and patients was an independent risk factor for worse outcomes. Design: Retrospective cohort study (January 2012 to December 2017). Operations were identified based on current procedural terminology code. Logistic and negative binomial regression were used to adjust for baseline comorbidities, case risk, and socioeconomic factors. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to evaluate mortality. Setting: Urban, tertiary referral and safety-net hospital. Patients (or Other Participants): Adult patients were stratified as English-speaking (ENG), Spanish/Creole-speaking (SpCr), or Non-English, Non-Spanish/Creole speaking (NENS).  Interventions (if any): N/a Main Outcome Measure(s): 30-day readmission, length of stay (LOS), and all-cause mortality Results: 2470 patients were included. Most operations were low risk (87.2\%) and there was no difference in case risk between language groups. Patients in non-English groups were more likely to be uninsured/self-pay and lived in neighborhoods with lower median income. After adjustment we found no difference in the odds of readmission for SpCr vs ENG (Odds Ratio 1.00, 95\%CI [0.65-1.52] ) or NENS vs ENG (1.36 [0.85-2.12]). There was no difference in LOS. Among patients who died, there was no difference in the hazard of mortality: SpCr vs ENG (HR (2.07 [0.91-4.72]), NENS vs ENG (1.29 [0.51-3.29]). Conclusions: We found no association between language and outcomes after cancer operations. This lack of difference may reflect system-level efficacy at treating non-English speaking patients. It may also suggest that communication barriers do not have an independent impact on the outcomes measured here. Other outcomes, e.g., patient satisfaction, might show different results.}

  abstract = {Objective: Emergency General Surgery (EGS) encompasses high risk patients undergoing high risk procedures. Admission source, particularly interhospital transfers, is rarely accounted for clinical performance benchmarking. Our goal was to assess the impact of transferred patients on outcomes following EGS. Design: Retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database (2005-2014). Setting: High-quality surgical outcomes data from more than 80 US hospitals participating in ACS NSQIP. Patients: All inpatients that underwent one of 7 EGS procedures shown to represent 80\% of EGS volume, complications, and mortality nationally. Interventions: Admission source was classified as directly admitted versus transferred from an outside emergency room or an acute care facility. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes were overall mortality, overall morbidity and major morbidity. Results: A total of 619,174 EGS admissions were identified, of which 31,173 (5\%) were transfers. Mean age was 55.8 years and 52\% were female. Overall mortality was 2.8\% for the entire cohort and 10.1\% within the transfer group. After risk adjustment for 33 clinical and demographic variables, transferred patients had higher rates of overall mortality (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.12, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05 - 1.21), higher overall morbidity (OR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.22 - 1.34) and major morbidity (OR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.21 - 1.37) when compared with directly admitted patients. Conclusions: After rigorous risk adjustment, interhospital transfer status is an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity in the EGS population. This increased burden on accepting institutions may have an impact on quality metrics and should be considered for benchmarking of clinical performance.},

  abstract = {Introduction:  There is a gap in the literature with regards to the influence of patient-level factors affecting palliative and hospice care. We hypothesized that, while there is some sparse data specifically pointing to racial disparities in the appropriate receipt of hospice and palliative care, given our status as a safety-net urban hospital, this would not be evident at our institution.   Methods:  We conducted a retrospective review of 2321 adult patients (age {$\geq$}18) that died within 6 months of admission to our institution between 2012 and 2017. Patients were included for analysis if their demographic information was complete, their length of stay was more than 48 hours and if based on their diagnoses as determined by literature review and expert consensus, they would have benefited from palliative care consultation (PCC) either during their inpatient hospitalization or as outpatients. Bayesian regression with a weakly informative prior was used to find the odds ratio (OR) and 99\% credible interval (CrI) of receiving PCC based on race. Knowing that PCC is differentially used at our institution between medical and surgical services, we analyzed this data stratified by the patient's primary management service. Results: Among the 730 patients who fit our inclusion criteria, 44.9\% (n=328) were White, 40.8\% (n=298) were Black, 10.1\% (n=74) were Hispanic, and 4.1\% (30) identified as belonging to a different races. Overall, 24.7\% (n=81) of Whites, 35.9\% (n=107) of Blacks, 32.4\% (n=24) of Hispanics, and 30.0\% (n=9) of other races received PCC. Knowing that patients primarily managed by surgical services at our institution have significantly lower odds of receiving PCC at our institution than patients managed by medical services, we found no statistically significant racial disparities on PCC utilization when we stratified the data by whether the patient was managed primarily by surgical vs. medical services. However, among Black patients referral to PCC tends to be higher while among Hispanic patients that PCC tends to be lower with larger uncertainty (Table). Conclusion: At our institution, we found no evidence of racial disparities affecting PCC. This is in contrast to previous reports in the literature highlighting the differential use of palliative care and hospice in racial minorities. Further investigation is warranted to examine whether the type (safety-net vs. not) and location (urban vs. rural) of a hospital, along with other systems, patients, and provider-level factors, influences this non-discriminatory utilization of palliative care and hospice services.}

  abstract = {Objective: Published studies promoting minimally invasive pancreatectomy have been criticized for high-volume and/or single center bias. We sought to compare surgical and oncologic outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) versus open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) in lower-volume hospitals.  Design: Retrospective cohort study  Setting: Low-volume hospitals ({$\leq$} 5 distal pancreatectomies per year).  Patients: Patients {$\geq$} 18 years old with any pancreatic cancer who underwent distal pancreatectomy at a low-volume center between 2010 and 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Propensity scores were created for the odds of undergoing LDP. Patients were matched 1:1 based on propensity score.  Interventions: LDP vs. ODP.  Main outcome measures: 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, median hospital length of stay (LOS), unplanned 30-day readmission, surgical margins, number of lymph nodes harvested, and survival.  Results: Of the 2,842 eligible patients, 902 (31.7\%) underwent LDP and 1,940 (68.3\%) underwent ODP. Overall, 203 (22.5\%) laparoscopic cases were converted to open. After matching, LDP was predictive of decreased 90-day mortality (3.6\% vs. 5.9\%; p=0.0196), shorter LOS (6 vs. 7 days; p{$<$}0.0001), and fewer positive resection margins (12.5\% vs. 18.5\%; p=0.0004). There were no differences with respect to 30-day mortality (1.7\% vs. 2.9\%; p=0.0823), readmission (9.6\% vs. 7.4\%; p=0.0920), and number of lymph nodes harvested (7 vs. 8 nodes; p=0.2113). For pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients demonstrated similar median overall survival for patients who underwent LDP versus ODP (23.4 vs. 22.3 months; log-rank p=0.2460) after propensity-score matching. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that, even in low-volume settings, LDP is associated with reduced 90-day mortality, shorter length of hospital stay, and lower rates of positive resection margins in well-selected patients.}
