  abstract = {Introduction:  Emergency General Surgery (EGS) represents a diverse set of operations performed on acutely ill and injured patients. The EGS patient population is diverse and increasingly from less advantaged cohorts, who have a higher likelihood of not speaking English (ENG). However, the effect of primary language on EGS outcomes has not been studied. We aimed to evaluate the effect of non-English primary language on outcomes following EGS operations.  Methods:  The New Jersey Statewide Inpatient Database from 2009-2014 was used to evaluate cases identified as representing 80\% of the national EGS case volume. Cases were restricted to ages {$>$}18, resulted from emergency department admissions, were noted to be emergent or urgent, and were performed between 0-2 days after admission. We evaluated outcomes for Spanish speakers (SPA) speakers and non-English/non-Spanish (NENS) speakers compared to ENG speakers. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, 7-day readmission, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Generalized linear mixed models were used to account for hierarchy in the data, and logistic and negative binomial regression were used to estimate odds ratios and incident rate ratios respectively. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess whether missing confounding variables could ablate effect estimates.  Results: 105,174 patients were included. A majority of ENG speakers were white and had private insurance; SPA speakers were younger and had fewer comorbidities. Where differences between SPA and NENS speakers existed, NENS speakers were more like the ENG speaking group. Readmission exhibited high between-hospital variability. Regression results are shown in the results table. After adjusting for operative risk, comorbid conditions, social determinants of health, and intra-hospital correlation, we found that non-English speakers had reduced LOS after appendectomy and lysis of adhesions. However, SPA speakers had an increased LOS following highest risk operations. There was no difference in mortality or short-term readmission in either language group compared to ENG. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the observed decreases in LOS were not robust to unmeasured confounding, while the increase in LOS among SPA speakers in the highest risk procedures was robust to additional confounding.  Conclusion: These data suggest SPA speakers are younger and healthier than ENG speakers, and that NENS speakers are more like ENG speakers than SPA speakers. Primary language does not have an independent impact on readmission or inpatient mortality following EGS operations. The effect of primary language on LOS after EGS depends on the type of operation. Future studies should focus on long term outcomes and generalizability to other regions of the United States},

  title = {A Simplified Method to Account for Multiple Case Adjustment in Regression Modeling.},
  year = {2020},
  month = feb,
  address = {{Orlando, Florida}},
  abstract = {Introduction: Heterogeneity of risk associated with different surgeries limits the ability of researchers to adjust for multiple different surgical procedures in a single study. The challenge arises because each operation has a different total risk, and moreover the total risk of each operation is a combination of risk types, such as overall mortality risk, major morbidity risk, etc. Further, if enough case types are included, solely adjusting for CPT code will create unstable estimates through overfitting. We aimed to design a method to adjust for multiple different operations in one analysis.   Methods: We used the ACS NSQIP calculator for the `average' patient to develop a mechanism to determine risk for each surgery type. Predicted probabilities for mortality, major morbidity, overall morbidity, readmission, and reoperations were extracted from the risk calculator as absolute values. The weighted summary score was produced using the following equation: weighted risk score=10*(mortality)+8*(major morbidity)+5*(overall morbidity) +4*(return to OR)+readmission. We then estimated the effect of adjusting for total risk using additive raw scores (i.e. unweighted) or using a summary risk score that is composed of additive weighted individual complications and compared it to adjusting for CPT code only. The effects were estimated in a simplified mock analysis of the effect of emergency surgery designation on mortality using NSQIP data and evaluating how the association of emergency surgery on mortality changed with different risk adjustment methods.  Results: There were 702,278 observations and 14,130 deaths. Fifty-four operations of disparate baseline risk were included.  Operations that are traditionally considered low risk, such as breast and thyroid operations, had low weighted summary risk scores. Conversely, operations that are typically considered high risk, such as pancreatectomy and hepatectomy, had high summary risk scores. Multiple adjustment methods were tested to determine if one was superior compared to adjusting solely for CPT score (Table 1). Adjustment for confounding was similar across weighting schemes. Including raw scores was most similar to including CPT codes alone, but required 54 dummy variables whereas the raw score only required addition of 5 variables and the weighted summary score only consisted of 1 variable.  Conclusion: We have developed a method to account for variable case risk in regression analysis when multiple operations are included. This method is particularly advantageous when the number of operation types included is large while the event rate is relatively small. To our knowledge this is the first attempt at creating a score like this for use in regression analysis.}
